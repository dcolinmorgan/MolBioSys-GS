                   of biological systems by integrating experimental and
                   theoretical techniques. During the last decade, many
                   systems biological approaches that base on
                   genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the
                   complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with
                   the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
                   from experimental data through computational methods.
                   Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene
                   expression data derived from microarrays. However,
                   the incorporation of additional information from
                   heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and
                   protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the
                   network inference process. This review focuses on
                   promising modelling approaches that use such diverse
                   types of molecular biological information. In
                   particular, approaches are discussed that enable the
                   modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems.
                   The review provides an overview of common modelling
                   schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current
                   challenges in GRN modelling.},

                   can be defined as the process of identifying gene

                   computational analysis. Gene expression data from
                   microarrays are typically used for this purpose. Here

                   that had been tested on experimental data sets. We
                   show that reverse-engineering algorithms are indeed
                   able to correctly infer regulatory interactions among
                   genes, at least when one performs perturbation
                   experiments complying with the algorithm
                   requirements. These algorithms are superior to
                   classic clustering algorithms for the purpose of
                   finding regulatory interactions among genes, and,
                   although further improvements are needed, have
                   reached a discreet performance for being practically

                   been an intensively studied topic in bioinformatics
                   since it constitutes an intermediate step from
                   explorative to causative gene expression analysis.
                   Many methods have been proposed through recent years
                   leading to a wide range of mathematical approaches.
                   In practice, different mathematical approaches will
                   generate different resulting network structures,
                   thus, it is very important for users to assess the
                   performance of these algorithms. We have conducted a
                   comparative study with six different reverse
                   engineering methods, including relevance networks,
                   neural networks, and Bayesian networks. Our approach
                   consists of the generation of defined benchmark data,
                   the analysis of these data with the different
                   methods, and the assessment of algorithmic
                   performances by statistical analyses. Performance was
                   judged by network size and noise levels. The results
                   of the comparative study highlight the neural network

                   (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2
                   years. We have kept up-to-date the knowledge from the
                   published literature regarding transcriptional
                   regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. We have
                   maintained and expanded our curation efforts to
                   improve the breadth and quality of the encoded
                   experimental knowledge, and we have implemented
                   criteria for the quality of our computational
                   predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide
                   high-level descriptions of regulatory regions. We
                   expanded the assignment of quality to various sources
                   of evidence, particularly for knowledge generated
                   through high-throughput (HT) technology. Based on our
                   analysis of most relevant methods, we defined rules
                   for determining the quality of evidence when multiple
                   independent sources support an entry. With this
                   latest release of RegulonDB, we present a new highly
                   reliable larger collection of transcription start
                   sites, a result of our experimental HT genome-wide
                   efforts. These improvements, together with several
                   novel enhancements (the tracks display, uploading
                   format and curational guidelines), address the
                   challenges of incorporating HT-generated knowledge
                   into RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary
                   conservation of regulatory elements is also available
                   now. Altogether, RegulonDB version 8.0 is a much
                   better home for integrating knowledge on gene
                   regulation from the sources of information currently

                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Last updated in June 2013,
                   this database contains over 200 000 regulatory
                   associations between transcription factors (TFs) and
                   target genes, including 326 DNA binding sites for 113
                   TFs. All regulatory associations stored in YEASTRACT
                   were revisited and new information was added on the
                   experimental conditions in which those associations
                   take place and on whether the TF is acting on its
                   target genes as activator or repressor. Based on this
                   information, new queries were developed allowing the

                   TFs controlling a gene or genome-wide response by
                   their relative importance, based on (i) the
                   percentage of target genes in the data set; (ii) the
                   enrichment of the TF regulon in the data set when

                   prioritizes the relevant TFs by walking through the

  abstract =      {MOTIVATION: Over the last decade, numerous methods
                   have been developed for inference of regulatory
                   networks from gene expression data. However, accurate
                   and systematic evaluation of these methods is
                   hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate
                   benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated
                   analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks.
                   RESULTS: Here we describe a novel and comprehensive
                   method for in silico benchmark generation and
                   performance profiling of network inference methods
                   available to the community as an open-source software
                   called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the
                   generation of detailed dynamical models of gene
                   regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW
                   provides a network motif analysis that reveals
                   systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating
                   potential ways of improving inference methods. The
                   accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated
                   using standard metrics such as precision-recall and
                   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We
                   show how GNW can be used to assess the performance
                   and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six
                   inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to
                   provide the international DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse
                   Engineering Assessments and Methods) competition with
                   three network inference challenges (DREAM3, DREAM4,
                   and DREAM5). AVAILABILITY: GNW is available at

                   (GRNs) is a central goal of bioinformatics highly
                   accelerated by the advent of new experimental
                   techniques, such as RNA interference. A battery of
                   reverse engineering methods has been developed in
                   recent years to reconstruct the underlying GRNs from
                   these and other experimental data. However, the
                   performance of the individual methods is poorly
                   understood and validation of algorithmic performances
                   is still missing to a large extent. To enable such
                   systematic validation, we have developed the web
                   application GeNGe (GEne Network GEnerator), a
                   controlled framework for the automatic generation of
                   GRNs. The theoretical model for a GRN is a non-linear
                   differential equation system. Networks can be
                   user-defined or constructed in a modular way with the
                   option to introduce global and local network
                   perturbations. Resulting data can be used, e.g. as
                   benchmark data for evaluating GRN reconstruction
                   methods or for predicting effects of perturbations as
                   theoretical counterparts of biological experiments.

  abstract =      {In the context of reverse engineering of biological
                   networks, simulators are helpful to test and compare
                   the accuracy of different reverse-engineering
                   approaches in a variety of experimental conditions. A
                   novel gene-network simulator is presented that
                   resembles some of the main features of
                   transcriptional regulatory networks related to
                   topology, interaction among regulators of
                   transcription, and expression dynamics. The simulator
                   generates network topology according to the current
                   knowledge of biological network organization,
                   including scale-free distribution of the connectivity
                   and clustering coefficient independent of the number
                   of nodes in the network. It uses fuzzy logic to
                   represent interactions among the regulators of each
                   gene, integrated with differential equations to
                   generate continuous data, comparable to real data for
                   variety and dynamic complexity. Finally, the
                   simulator accounts for saturation in the response to
                   regulation and transcription activation thresholds
                   and shows robustness to perturbations. It therefore
                   provides a reliable and versatile test bed for
                   reverse engineering algorithms applied to microarray
                   data. Since the simulator describes regulatory
                   interactions and expression dynamics as two distinct,
                   although interconnected aspects of regulation, it can
                   also be used to test reverse engineering approaches
                   that use both microarray and protein-protein
                   interaction data in the process of learning. A first
                   software release is available at

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND:In the last decade, a great number of
                   methods for reconstructing gene regulatory networks
                   from expression data have been proposed. However,
                   very few tools and datasets allow to evaluate
                   accurately and reproducibly those methods. Hence, we
                   propose here a new tool, able to perform a
                   systematic, yet fully reproducible, evaluation of
                   transcriptional network inference methods.RESULTS:Our
                   open-source and freely available Bioconductor package
                   aggregates a large set of tools to assess the
                   robustness of network inference algorithms against
                   different simulators, topologies, sample sizes and
                   noise intensities.CONCLUSIONS:The benchmarking
                   framework that uses various datasets highlights the
                   specialization of some methods toward network types
                   and data. As a result, it is possible to identify the
                   techniques that have broad overall performances.},

                   networks of the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi type, or regular
                   networks, despite it being recognized for some time
                   that anatomical brain networks are more complex in
                   their connectivity and can, for example, exhibit the
                   `scale-free' and `small-world' properties. We review
                   the most well known algorithms for constructing
                   networks with given non-homogeneous statistical
                   properties and provide simple pseudo-code for
                   reproducing such networks in software simulations. We
                   also review some useful mathematical results and
                   approximations associated with the statistics that
                   describe these network models, including degree

                   overlooked modeling choice that can be crucially
                   important for the properties of simulated networks:
                   that of network directedness. The most well known
                   network algorithms produce undirected networks, and
                   we emphasize this point by highlighting how simple
                   adaptations can instead produce directed networks.},

  abstract =      {Analysis of gene expression data sets reveals that
                   the variation in expression is concentrated to
                   significantly fewer 'characteristic modes' or
                   'eigengenes' than the number of both recorded assays
                   and measured genes. Previous works have stressed the
                   importance of these characteristic modes, but
                   neglected the equally important weak modes. Herein a
                   generic system property - interampatteness - is
                   defined that explains the previous feature, and
                   assigns equal weight to the characteristic and weak
                   modes. An interampatte network is characterised by
                   strong INTERactions enabling simultaneous
                   AMPlification and ATTEnuation of different signals.
                   It is postulated that biochemical networks are
                   interampatte, based on published experimental data
                   and theoretical considerations. Existence of multiple
                   time-scales and feedback loops is shown to increase
                   the degree of interampatteness. Interampatteness has
                   strong implications for the dynamics and reverse
                   engineering of the network. One consequence is highly
                   correlated changes in gene expression in response to
                   external perturbations, even in the absence of common
                   transcription factors, implying that interampatte
                   gene regulatory networks erroneously may be assumed
                   to have co-expressed/co-regulated genes. Data
                   compression or reduction of the system dimensionality
                   using clustering, singular value decomposition,
                   principal component analysis or some other data
                   mining technique results in a loss of information
                   that will obstruct reconstruction of the underlying
                   network. Includes supplementary material.},

  abstract =      {In this thesis, inference of biological networks from
                   in vivo data generated by perturbation experiments is
                   considered, i.e. deduction of causal interactions
                   that exist among the observed variables. Knowledge of
                   such regulatory influences is essential in biology. A
                   system property--interampatteness--is introduced that
                   explains why the variation in existing gene
                   expression data is concentrated to a few
                   "characteristic modes" or "eigengenes", and why
                   previously inferred models have a large number of
                   false positive and false negative links. An
                   interampatte system is characterized by strong
                   INTERactions enabling simultaneous AMPlification and
                   ATTEnuation of different signals and we show that
                   perturbation of individual state variables, e.g.
                   genes, typically leads to ill-conditioned data with
                   both characteristic and weak modes. The weak modes
                   are typically dominated by measurement noise due to
                   poor excitation and their existence hampers network
                   reconstruction. The excitation problem is solved by
                   iterative design of correlated multi-gene
                   perturbation experiments that counteract the
                   intrinsic signal attenuation of the system. The next
                   perturbation should be designed such that the
                   expected response practically spans an additional
                   dimension of the state space. The proposed design is
                   numerically demonstrated for the Snf1 signalling
                   pathway in S. cerevisiae. The impact of unperturbed
                   and unobserved latent state variables, that exist in
                   any real biological system, on the inferred network
                   and required set-up of the experiments for network
                   inference is analysed. Their existence implies that a
                   subnetwork of pseudo-direct causal regulatory
                   influences, accounting for all environmental effects,
                   in general is inferred. In principle, the number of
                   latent states and different paths between the nodes
                   of the network can be estimated, but their identity
                   cannot be determined unless they are observed or
                   perturbed directly. Network inference is recognized
                   as a variable/model selection problem and solved by
                   considering all possible models of a specified class
                   that can explain the data at a desired significance
                   level, and by classifying only the links present in
                   all of these models as existing. As shown, these
                   links can be determined without any parameter
                   estimation by reformulating the variable selection
                   problem as a robust rank problem. Solution of the
                   rank problem enable assignment of confidence to
                   individual interactions, without resorting to any
                   approximation or asymptotic results. This is
                   demonstrated by reverse engineering of the synthetic
                   IRMA gene regulatory network from published data. A
                   previously unknown activation of transcription of
                   SWI5 by CBF1 in the IRMA strain of S. cerevisiae is
                   proven to exist, which serves to illustrate that even
                   the accumulated knowledge of well studied genes is
                   incomplete.},

                   determination of the regulatory interactions between
                   a set of genes) provides mechanistic insights of
                   central importance to research in systems biology.
                   Most contemporary network inference methods rely on a
                   sparsity/regularization coefficient, which we call
                   $\zeta$ (zeta), to determine the degree of sparsity
                   of the network estimates, that is, the total number
                   of links between the nodes. However, they offer
                   little or no advice on how to select this sparsity
                   coefficient, in particular, for biological data with
                   few samples. We show that an empty network is more
                   accurate than estimates obtained for a poor choice of
                   $\zeta$. In order to avoid such poor choices, we
                   propose a method for optimization of $\zeta$, which
                   maximizes the accuracy of the inferred network for
                   any sparsity-dependent inference method and data set.
                   Our procedure is based on leave-one-out
                   cross-optimization and selection of the ? value that
                   minimizes the prediction error. We also illustrate
                   the adverse effects of noise, few samples, and
                   uninformative experiments on network inference as
                   well as our method for optimization of $\zeta$. We
                   demonstrate that our $\zeta$ optimization method for
                   two widely used inference algorithms -- Glmnet and
                   NIR -- gives accurate and informative estimates of
                   the network structure, given that the data is
                   informative enough.},

                   squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of
                   the coefficients being less than a constant. Because
                   of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce
                   some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives
                   interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest
                   that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable
                   properties of both subset selection and ridge
                   regression. It produces interpretable models like
                   subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge

                   Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general

                   the concentration of proteins and metabolites, is
                   tightly controlled in the cell. This is possible
                   thanks to complex regulatory networks between these
                   different elements. The identification of these
                   networks would be extremely valuable. We developed a
                   novel algorithm to identify a large genetic network,
                   as a set of linear differential equations, starting
                   from measurements of gene expression at steady state
                   following transcriptional perturbations.
                   Experimentally, it is possible to overexpress each of
                   the genes in the network using an episomal expression
                   plasmid and measure the change in mRNA concentration
                   of all the genes, following the perturbation.
                   Computationally, we reduced the identification

                   correctly identify the network, even in the presence

                   predict the genes that directly mediate the action of

                   network, especially in a large scale network. The
                   authors develop a novel algorithm for identifying the
                   smallest genetic network that explains genetic
                   perturbation experimental data. By construction, our
                   identification algorithm is able to incorporate and
                   respect a priori knowledge known about the network
                   structure. A priori biological knowledge is typically
                   qualitative, encoding whether one gene affects
                   another gene or not, or whether the effect is
                   positive or negative. The method is based on a convex
                   programming relaxation of the combinatorially hard
                   problem of L(0) minimisation. The authors apply the
                   proposed method to the identification of a subnetwork
                   of the SOS pathway in Escherichia coli, the
                   segmentation polarity network in Drosophila
                   melanogaster, and an artificial network for measuring
                   the performance of the method.},

  year =          {2006},
  abstract =      {Sparsity or parsimony of statistical models is
                   crucial for their proper interpretations, as in
                   sciences and social sciences. Model selection is a
                   commonly used method to find such models, but usually
                   involves a computationally heavy combinatorial
                   search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as
                   a computationally feasible alternative to model
                   selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso
                   for model selection purposes. In this paper, we prove
                   that a single condition, which we call the
                   Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and
                   sufficient for Lasso to select the true model both in
                   the classical fixed p setting and in the large p
                   setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on
                   these results, sufficient conditions that are
                   verifiable in practice are given to relate to
                   previous works and help applications of Lasso for
                   feature selection and sparse representation. This
                   Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on
                   the covariance of the predictor variables, states
                   that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and
                   (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the
                   true model are "irrepresentable" (in a sense to be
                   clarified) by predictors that are in the true model.
                   Furthermore, simulations are carried out to provide
                   insights and understanding of this result.},

                   estimation (model calibration) and optimal
                   experimental design. Parameter estimation aims to
                   find the unknown parameters of the model which give
                   the best fit to a set of experimental data. Optimal
                   experimental design aims to devise the dynamic
                   experiments which provide the maximum information
                   content for subsequent non-linear model
                   identification, estimation and/or discrimination. We
                   place emphasis on the need for robust global
                   optimization methods for proper solution of these
                   problems, and we present a motivating example

                   model discrimination constitute important tools for
                   scientists and engineers, as analyzed phenomena can
                   very often be described fairly well by different
                   mathematical models. As interpretation and use of
                   available experimental data depend on the model
                   structure, techniques for design of experiments for
                   selection of the best model are of fundamental
                   importance. Besides, experiments must often be
                   designed for estimation of model parameters and
                   reduction of variances of model predictions (or
                   parameter estimates). These two classes of
                   experimental design techniques generally lead to
                   different experimental designs, although model
                   discrimination and reduction of variances of
                   parameter estimates are closely related to each
                   other. In this work the posterior covariance matrix
                   of difference between model predictions is taken into
                   account during the design for model discrimination
                   for the first time. The obtained results show that
                   the model discrimination power becomes much higher
                   when the posterior covariance matrix of difference
                   between model predictions are considered during the
                   experimental design, increasing the capability of
                   model discrimination and simultaneously leading to
                   improved parameter estimates.},

                   strategies aiming at maximizing the parameter
                   precision are regularly applied in industry and
                   academia, only a little attention has been payed to
                   OED techniques for model discrimination in practical
                   applications. A broader use of these techniques is
                   mainly hindered by two drawbacks: (i) The use of such
                   techniques is desirable in an early model
                   identification phase, where only a little knowledge
                   on the process is available. The known methods,
                   however, rely on good estimates of the parameters of
                   all candidate model structures. (ii) The available
                   methods are tailored to few (ideally two) model
                   candidates and do not work well if numerous candidate
                   structures are taken into account. In this work we
                   propose a novel design criterion for model-based OED
                   for model discrimination in the case of multiple
                   model candidates. The resulting OED method is thus
                   well-suited for designing experiments in an early
                   stage of the model identification process to
                   efficiently reduce the number of model candidates,
                   thereby reducing the overall cost for model
                   identification.},
